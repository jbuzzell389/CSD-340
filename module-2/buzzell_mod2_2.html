        <h2>The Life of James</h2>
        <p class="intro">
           My name is James Buzzell I would like to introduce myself.
           I have lived in NE for about 17 years. I work as a project manager.
        </p>
        <p>I grew up in small city in NH.
            <span class="sentence">My childhood neighborhood was very friendly, 
                                   and I walked across the street to go to school.</span>
           My best friend was named JT.
        </p>
        <p>My main hobby is music, but I also enjoy the gym, the outdoors,
           and cooking. I have been a musician most of my life and have 
           been working on songwriting/producing lately. I love to grill 
           ribeye steaks every so often and also enjoy cooking several other dishes.
        </p>
        <p>My dad’s side of the family is just as close as my mom’s side. My dad grew 
           up in MA, and my mom is from Ghana, West Africa. I have one younger sister 
           and one older sister. Well, that’s me! Thanks for reading.
